=head1 Paths and actions

Different pages of your application need to be able to reference each other,
and doing this by hardcoding URL paths is fairly fragile. URLs are the external
API to your application, and may need to change for all kinds of different
reasons, including things like SEO and general aesthetics which are frequently
dictated by the client. Tying any part of your application's functionality to
URL paths themselves is a good way to make the application hard to modify as
time goes on.

What we need is a way to refer to application endpoints using an internal
identifier instead of an external one. Luckily, we already have one. Yesterday
we saw how you could access the mapping for the current route via
C<< $r->mapping >>. The inverse operation to C<< $r->mapping >> is
C<< $r->uri_for >>. C<uri_for> takes a mapping hashref and returns the URI path
corresponding to that mapping.

For instance, given these routes:

=begin vim perl

  route '/'               => 'root.index';
  route '/view/:id'       => 'root.view';
  route '/admin/view/:id' => 'root.view', (
      section => 'admin',
  );

=end vim

In this case, C<< $r->uri_for({ controller => 'root', action => 'index' }) >>
will return C<"/">,
C<< $r->uri_for({ controller => 'root', action => 'view', id => 123 }) >> will
return C<"/view/123">, and
C<< $r->uri_for({ controller => 'root', action => 'view', id => 123, section => 'admin' }) >>
will return C<"/admin/view/123">.

Additionally, you only have to specify enough of the mapping to make it unique.
For instance, if the three routes listed above were the only routes in the
application, C<< $r->uri_for({ section => 'admin', id => 123 }) >> would also
be sufficient to return C<"/admin/view/123">.

=head2 The C<name> entry

This can still be a bit verbose though, so there is a shorthand to make the
common case easier. If you pass in just a single string to C<uri_for>, it will
be treated as though you passed a mapping with that string as the C<name>
value. This allows you to give the various routes in your application unique
(and meaningful) names, and access them easily. If you say:

=begin vim perl

  route '/' => 'root.index';
  route '/about' => 'root.about', (
      name => 'about',
  );

=end vim

then you can use C<< $r->uri_for('about') >> to access the C<"/about"> page.

In addition, the ControllerAction and HTTPMethod route builders also by default
set the C<name> value to be the action spec. This means that in the previous
example, C<< $r->uri_for('root.index') >> can also be used to access the C<"/">
path.
