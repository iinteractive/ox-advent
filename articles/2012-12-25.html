Topic: OX

So we made it through 24 days of articles! Although OX is still a pretty young
framework, hopefully you got some idea of the possibilities, and how it can be
used in your applications. We're still actively working on making it better,
and are very interested to see how it will be used in the wild.

I'd like to thank John Anderson and Shawn M Moore for contributions to the
advent calendar this year. I'd also like to thank L<Infinity
Interactive|http://www.iinteractive.com/> for providing a lot of my time for
working on both OX and this advent calendar. We can always use more
contributors, so if anyone has any suggestions, or patches, or questions, we'll
be around in C<#ox> on C<irc.perl.org>. Bug reports or feature requests are
also welcome, either on L<RT|http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=OX> or
L<GitHub|https://github.com/iinteractive/OX/issues>.

Happy holidays, and hope to see you around!
