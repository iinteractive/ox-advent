=head1 The C<mount> keyword

The C<mount> keyword allows you to include other L<PSGI> applications inside
your application, under a given request path. For instance, if you have static
files that need to be served, you can create a L<Plack::App::File> instance and
mount it under C</static>, so that any request for a path underneath C</static>
will be delegated to the Plack::App::File app.

You can specify an app in one of four ways:

=over 4

=item *

A PSGI coderef

=begin vim perl

  mount '/static' => Plack::App::File->new(root => "static")->to_app;

=end vim

In this case, the coderef is delegated to directly.

=item *

An object

=begin vim perl

  mount '/static' => Plack::App::File->new(root => "static");

=end vim

The object will have C<to_app> called on it, and the result of that will be
used for the mount.

=item *

The name of a class

=begin vim perl

  mount '/static' => "Plack::App::File", (
      root     => 'static_root',
      encoding => literal('latin1'),
  );

=end vim

This will first instantiate a new instance of the class, and then use that
instance as described in the previous bullet point. The instance will be
instantiated via Bread::Board, so it can depend on services that your
application has declared. The dependencies should be listed as a hash after the
name of the class.

=item *

Another router

=begin vim perl

  mount '/auth' => router as {
      route '/login' => 'auth.login';
      # ...
  };

=end vim

This will allow you to create separate sections of your application under
certain request paths. These will be able to define all of their own
middleware, routes, and mounts, but will share the attributes defined in the
main app. In this example, a request for C</auth/login> will be handled by the
C<auth.login> action.
