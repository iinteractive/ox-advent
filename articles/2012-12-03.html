Title: Routes and Path::Router

=head1 Routing

Routing is the step that takes an HTTP request and decides what code should
actually be run. Although any part of the request can be used here, in practice
routing happens by only looking at the path (and maybe the HTTP method).

L<Path::Router> is a module which can take an incoming path and return which of
a set of route definitions it matched. OX uses this as the basis for its
routing. Path::Router handles solely the path aspect of routing - routing based
on other things (such as HTTP methods) must be handled via route builders.

=head2 Basic routes

=begin vim perl

  router as {
      route '/'           => 'root.index';
      route '/archive'    => 'posts.archive';
      route '/auth/login' => 'auth.login';
  };

=end vim

The simplest pattern for matching paths consists of just a literal string, to
be matched against the incoming path. This only looks at the path itself (to be
specific, the L<PSGI> C<PATH_INFO> variable), so any query parameters are
ignored. If the path in the incoming request is equal to any of the paths
defined in the router, that path is chosen, and its associated code is run to
create the response. If no path matches, a 404 response is returned.

=head2 Route variables

Some routes need to contain variable components. These can be specified by a
leading colon:

=begin vim perl

  router as {
      route '/:id' => sub { my ($r, $id) = @_; return $id };
  };

=end vim

In this case, this route doesn't match just the path C</view/:id>, but any path
that starts with C</view/> and contains exactly one additional path component:
C</view/24>, C</view/c9625979-976a-4cf1-b557-7cf5bd591d0d>, etc. When the code
for the route is called, the variable path components will be passed as
additional arguments, in order, after the request object.

Variable routes do make routing more complicated, however, since paths can now
potentially match multiple different routes. If a path is given which does
match multiple routes, the route with the fewest variable path components is
chosen. For instance, given this router:

=begin vim perl

  router as {
      route '/view/:id'    => 'posts.view_specific_post';
      route '/view/default => 'posts.view_default_post';
  };

=end vim

a request for C</view/default> will match the C<view_default_post> route. If
there are multiple routes with the fewest variable path components, an error
will be thrown (so don't do that).

=head3 Optional routes

Sometimes the path component isn't actually necessary at all. In this case, you
can prefix the path variable with a question mark to indicate that including it
is not actually necessary (path components must otherwise be non-empty
strings). For instance:

=begin vim perl

  router as {
      route '/view/?:id' => 'posts.view_specific_post';
  };

=end vim

In this case, C</view> is also a valid path, and the argument passed to the
route's code will be C<undef>.

=head3 Validations

Sometimes you want a bit more control than just "does the path component
exist?". In this case, you can specify constraints to validate the path
variables. For instance:

=begin vim perl

  router as {
      route '/view/:id' => 'posts.view_by_id', (
          id => { isa => 'Int' },
      );
      route '/view/:search' => 'posts.search', (
          id => { isa => qr/^\w/ },
      );
  };

=end vim

This will route C</view/123> to C<view_by_id>, and C</view/foobar> to
C<search>. Validations must be specified by a hash following the action spec,
where the keys are names of variable path components and the values are
hashrefs with an C<isa> entry. Each validation can be either a Moose type
constraint (a type name or a type constraint object) or a regular expression.
