Title: Wrapping things up

=head1 Taking a step back

So now that we've seen all of the things that OX is capable of, I hope that you
have a better idea of how you can use OX in your own applications. We've been
using OX internally at work for quite some time, and it has been very
successful in making our applications more readable, configurable, and
testable.

Being able to structure our apps as the design requires rather than requiring a
specific layout of classes has been a huge win, both in encouraging us to
actually think about the design of the application and in allowing us to more
generally share components between applications. Basing OX on Bread::Board has
also made it much easier to integrate into our other applications which already
have a Bread::Board structure.

OX has also provided solutions for some of the more common pain points we have
run into with other frameworks. Things like being able to easily rearrange URL
structures and reuse application components outside of the context of a web
request have been huge helps in making our code more flexible to accomodating
client requests. Having a centralized router definition and using Perl concepts
like method calling and exceptions in favor of framework-specific concepts like
forwarding and detaching actions has made it much easier to jump into code and
see exactly which code will be run for a given request.

Finally, focusing on tying together existing code rather than requiring a lot
of glue encourages writing reusable code. There have been several instances of
being able to release something as a generic Plack middleware (or something
along those lines) that can be used by other people and other frameworks, which
may not have happened had our framework required its own custom plugin system.
It also helps with being able to reuse internal components between
applications, especially if not all of those applications use OX.

=head1 Moving forward

Although we use OX at work, this doesn't provide a very wide range of
experience with its various capabilities. Right now, we could really use more
people using it, to give more different perspectives on how well the different
features work. While we're fairly confident about the way most parts work,
there are certain aspects that are newer or less well tested:

Route builders

Is the default set of route builders sufficient, or are there more common
patterns we want to provide? Also, is the interface for writing and using
custom route builders straightforward and functional enough?

=item *

Auto-encoding

Auto-encoding everything as UTF-8 by default is clearly the right way to go for
new code, but the way we interface with this currently is a bit clunky (since
not all endpoints will want to be auto-encoded - for instance, downloads of
binary files). Can we provide a better way to do this?

=item *

Router block configuration

There are cases where we want to only enable parts of the application under
certain configurations - we may want to include extra debugging code only on
staging servers, for instance, or our application may have several different
states that it needs to switch between depending on configuration that we
update at various points dictated by the client. Right now, the router block is
fixed, and must be declared before any instance of the application is created,
which means we can't access any of the configuration data that is passed to the
application's constructor. What is a good solution here?

=back

In addition, we are also very open to new ideas, if the current interfaces are
not sufficient for your needs. Although we've put a decent amount of effort
into making things easy to get running, certain aspects are still more low
level than perhaps they should be. Identifying which aspects these are requires
more use in real world situations.

We keep the current TODO list in the
L<GitHub wiki|https://github.com/iinteractive/ox/wiki>, so if you have any
feedback on items in that list, or new ideas for things you think we should
consider, please do also let us know.
