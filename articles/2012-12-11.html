=head1 Plack

OX interacts with web servers entirely via PSGI. This means that you can use
any of the tools provided by L<Plack> to manage and deploy your OX
applications. Plack provides functionality to run your app on many different
application servers, tools to manage your application during development and
deployment, and several middleware classes to fix deployment issues in various
situations.

=head2 C<app.psgi> and C<plackup>

Plack's tools typically interact with applications via C<.psgi> files. This is
a file which, when evaluated, returns a PSGI application coderef. As mentioned
previously, an OX application as typically written is a valid C<.psgi> file:

=begin vim perl

  # app.psgi
  use OX;

  router as {
      route '/' => sub { "Hello world!" };
  };

=end vim

but this quickly becomes unwieldy. Splitting your application into multiple
packages and files is important not only for code organization, but also
because having a split between code that is inherent to your application and
code that is specific to deployment makes the deployment process much easier.
For instance, if your application uses sessions, the
L<Session|Plack::Middleware::Session> middleware is conceptually part of the
application itself - running the application without that middleware applied
doesn't make a lot of sense. On the other hand, the
L<ReverseProxy|Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy> middleware is dependent on your
deployment environment - declaring that in your application doesn't make sense
because you might run your same application in several different environments,
only some of which use a reverse proxy.

The typical way that OX applications are written is to write them as a class:

=begin vim perl

  # Hello.pm
  package Hello;
  use OX;

  router as {
      route '/' => sub { "Hello world!" };
  };

  1;

=end vim

and then write an C<app.psgi> file which instantiates the application:

=begin vim perl

  # app.psgi
  use Hello;
  Hello->new->to_app;

=end vim

This way, you can easily add additional deployment-specific code to just the
C<app.psgi> file, to do whatever you need to do:

=begin vim perl

  # app.psgi
  use Hello;
  use Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy;

  my $app = Hello->new->to_app;
  $app = Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy->wrap($app);

  $app;

=end vim

L<Plack::Builder> can also be helpful for this.

=head1 Servers

Now that we have an C<app.psgi> file, we can run the application in any
application server supported by L<Plack::Loader>. By default, if you just run
C<plackup>, it will run your application using L<HTTP::Server::PSGI>. This is a
simple, single-process server which can be used during development. For your
actual deployment, however, you'll likely want to use a more fully-featured
server.

By passing the C<-s> option to C<plackup>, you can use any application server
which has a corresponding L<Plack::Handler> class. L<Starman> is a good example
of a production-ready application server. It is fast, preforking, and supports
all of HTTP/1.1. A typical Starman deployment involves running your application
with starman as a normal user on a port that isn't exposed to the public, and
then running a reverse proxy of some sort in front of it. This ensures that you
don't need to run your application itself as root, and also prevents attacks
like L<Slowloris|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris>, which Starman on its
own would otherwise be vulnerable to.

To run Starman, you can pass C<-s Starman> to your C<plackup> invocation, or
you can use the C<starman> runner script instead (which has more configuration
options available). You should also add the ReverseProxy middleware to your
C<app.psgi> file (to ensure that your application sees the correct values for
the C<host>). For the reverse proxy itself, something like
L<nginx|http://www.nginx.org/> works well, using a configuration like this:

  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name myapp.example.com;

      location / {
          proxy_set_header Host               $http_host;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host   $http_host;
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP          $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For    $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port   80;

          proxy_pass http://localhost:5000/;
      }
  }

You should adjust the port in the proxy_pass statement to point to the port
that you have Starman running on.

=head1 Further reading

If you need to deploy via other application servers or proxies, the Plack
documentation covers a great deal of this. All of the server-specific
documentation is covered in the L<Plack::Handler> classes (like
L<Plack::Handler::FCGI>, L<Plack::Handler::Apache2>, etc). In addition, the
L<Plack advent calendar|http://advent.plackperl.org/> contains a lot of useful
tips and tricks.
